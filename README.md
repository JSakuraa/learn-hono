# Learn Hono
This is a repo for a documented / type-safe API using Hono, drizzle, zod, and OpenAPI. It was completed by following a tutorial by Syntax on YouTube. The code was typed by me however it is not my own original thoughts.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
open http://localhost:3000
```
